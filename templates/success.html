            Bravo Leo! We made it! We have successfully recovered all the data of Nexus Entertainment that were lost into the Cyrus grid. Not only that, the solution to the weird file that you deduced was a major vulnerability in its network. <br><br>
            I inspected its entire network. The flag that you found previously is our only way to kill Cyrus entirely. <br> <br>
            Let’s do this Leo! Click the button below and let’s finish this once and for all!
